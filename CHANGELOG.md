## [1.2.0](https://github.com/frouo/promise-lite/releases/tag/1.2.0)

* Add support to `throw` error within Promise, `map` and `flapMap` functions.
* Add `finally` handler to a promise. The handler is called when the promise is settled, whether fulfilled or rejected.

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/frouo/promise-lite/releases/tag/1.1.0)

* Fix: the first `resolve` or `reject` that is reached wins and any further calls will be ignored.

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/frouo/promise-lite/releases/tag/1.0.0)

* A promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `map` or `flatMap` methods, which registers callbacks to receive either a promiseâ€™s eventual value or the reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.
